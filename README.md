# Escape Artist

`Escape Artist` is a small webapp for generating ANSI escape sequences quickly, so that adding colourful output to your shell scripts / one-off programs / anything is as lightweight as possible. Rather an adding a dependency or wading through the docs, just click a few boxes and copy-and-paste the result. 

It currently supports: 

- `Shell (Bash/Zsh/&c.)`
- `Python`
- `Rust`
- `JavaScript`
- `C`
- `C++`
- `<your language here?>`

## Working with it locally

`npm install` 
`npm run dev` 

you've been here before!
